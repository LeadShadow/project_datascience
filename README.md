### Image Classification Web Service using Convolutional Neural Networks
#### Technical Requirements. The task was to implement a web service that can classify images using Convolutional Neural Networks.
##### In the process of completing the task, an architecture for a convolutional neural network was developed, which can classify images into one of the 10 classes proposed in the Cifar10 dataset. Various techniques were used in this model, including expanding the training set and fine-tuning the VGG19 neural network. The optimal number of convolutional layers, different activation functions, and hyperparameters were chosen when building the architecture. To increase the accuracy of the model, data augmentation methods were used. It helps to avoid overfitting and achieved a model accuracy of 92%.
